# foshesUniverse

This repository is source code for my portfolio website ( foshesuniverse.com ). While I have published it and I am pretty happy with how it looks, there is still a lot that I want to do with it. What it's currently missing is support for screen-readers, potentially a dark mode, links to my socials, and the hamburger menu looks horrible (doesn't fit at all with the site).

Feel free to use any of the code for your own website if you'd like.
